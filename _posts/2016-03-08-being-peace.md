Religious scriptures advocate _being_ peace. By way of misunderstanding, unwholesome attachments, and unfounded aversions, not all followers practice their scripture's teachings on _being_ peace.

Humanist philosophies advocate _being_ peace. By way of misunderstanding, unwholesome attachments, and unfounded aversions, not all followers practice their philosophy's principles on _being_ peace.

**Personal behaviors not in keeping with _being_ peace:**

* **Hinders the evolution of planetary peace**
* **Contributes to the social and economic suffering of people everywhere**
* **Are instrumental in the irreparable harm being inflicted on our planet**

#### This is What Works for Me

_Being_ peace is a life-long, solitary, undertaking. _Being_ peace is not about mass gatherings, protest marches, or civil disobedience. There are plenty of good organizations doing that now. _Being_ peace is not about getting on a soapbox and righteously condemning this or that or them and they. There are plenty of well-intending others doing that too. _Being _peaceis more intimate, close in, personal. It's how we relate right where we are with others right around us. It's about manners, kindness, respect, and grace. It's about intending no harm. It's about being fully and deeply human; about recognizing and living in harmony with the oneness of all life. It's about _being_ the peace we want to see ... _being_ the peace felt in our hearts ... regardless of how others may interpret and represent our scriptures or ideologies.

If we're honest, when we look at the anger and the resulting suffering that's present all around us, we see manifestations of what's in our own mind and thoughts. We see the reflections of our own misunderstandings, unwholesome attachments, and unfounded aversions. When we look more deeply, we see that these peacefulness-killing poisons are rooted in our ignorance, fears, and prejudices.

**_The practice required for being peace is to uproot these poisons from our minds._**

Replacing ignorance with knowledge born of open-minded investigation helps us see how things really are. This leads to a realization ... an experiential and practical understanding of reality. Practical understanding of this kind replaces fear with confidence and courage and helps us let go of our unwholesome attachments. With clear and accurate understanding, insights arise and wisdom evolves helping us evaluate and correct the wrong perceptions that underlie the prejudices that form our unfounded aversions.

**_One step towards practical understanding is to practice self-reflection._**

It's essential that we cultivate the skill of being direct and honest with ourselves. It means learning how to pay attention to what's going on in our own minds and hearts; figuring out what's peacefulness and what's not, and how to accurately discern one from the other. Instead of unquestioningly accepting dogma and cultural conditioning, we cultivate the skill of looking deeply into our experiences to learn from what's going on inside of us ... in our minds, yes ... but especially in our hearts. We look to see if our religious and philosophical understanding leads us to treat others and our planet in ways that align with the practical characteristics of their teachings on _being _peace. If not, our interpretation of the teachings is wrong, our understanding of them is incorrect ... or both.

**_Another step towards practical understanding is to be independent thinkers._**

Many of us attach more importance to the form of our religion's or philosophy's identity than we do to the practical use of its teachings. It's wise to consider, with a healthy skepticism, how others may interpret and represent our sacred scriptures and philosophical principles. Being told by others what our religion or philosophy means or what to believe about how to _be_ comes to us from their point of view ... colored by their ignorance, fears, and prejudices. _Being_ peace is about personal realization ... not about unquestioning obedience to religious or academic authoritarianism.

_Being_ peace comes from inside of us because peace is already there. How to _be_ peace is intuitive and accessible when we're aware of and accept our heart-felt urgings. However, that we may not accept everything others tell us at face value doesn't mean we can always accept what we tell ourselves. Mind and heart may not always agree. A wise habit is to test all interpretations and practices against our own experience ... including our own ideas and opinions. The same is true for everything written here.

**_A third step towards practical understanding is to transcend our notion that the nature of reality is anything other than one shared phenomenon._**

The nature of reality, throughout the entire universe, is _inter_dependence ... the whole of it all is dependent upon its constituent and codependent parts. Nothing comes into existence by itself. Nothing continues to exist by itself. There's no independent anything anywhere. We can't survive as separate life forms independent of the whole of life on our planet. We're made of it. We're born into it. We live in it. We work in it. We breathe it. We drink it. We eat it. And, when we die we return to it.

**_If being peace is an essential condition for our collective survival, why ever be any other way?_**

Answering this question starts with looking deeply into our understanding of whether our own interpretations and understandings of religious scriptures and philosophical principles are in keeping with their practical teaching on _being_ peace. As we search for our answers, we can try our best to _be_ the peace we want to see ... to _be_ the peace felt in our hearts ... right where we are with others right around us. In this way, _being_ peace is possible for everyone.

**_"Each moment is a chance for us to make peace with the world, to make peace possible for the world, to make happiness possible for the world." - _****_Thich Nhat Hanh_**
