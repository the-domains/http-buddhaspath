_"The cultivation of loving-kindness and compassion is not intrinsically a religious endeavor. It has really a much more general pertinence and general applicability. You don't have to be religious or buy into a religious doctrine to do it. This is why I think it is important to develop techniques that are secular and not simply religious in orientation." - [The Dalai Lama][0]_

_Buddhism is not one. The teachings of Buddhism are many. When Buddhism enters a country, that country always acquires a new form of Buddhism. The teachings of Buddhism in this country will be different from other countries. Buddhism, in order to be Buddhism, must be suitable, appropriate to the psychology and culture of the society that it serves." - [Thich Naht Hanh][1]_

__"Being able to practice the Dhamma does not depend on being ordained as a monk. The qualities of good and bad are within us, they don't depend on being a monk or laywoman. We just need to develop goodness within us consistently, this is what really matters." _-- [Ajahn Chah][2]_

_"We do not practice meditation to gain admiration from anyone. Rather, we practice to contribute to peace in the world. We try to follow the teachings of the Buddha, and take the instructions of trustworthy teachers, in hopes that we too can reach the Buddha's state of purity. Having realized this purity within ourselves, we can inspire others and share this truth."_ -- [Sayadaw U Pandita][3]
